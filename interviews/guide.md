# Interview Guide
This guide was used to prepare, conduct and validate interviews.

## Interview Preparation
1. Select the question to be asked according to the interview goal and the interviewee's role.
2. Define the duration and estimate the number of questions that should fit in.

## Interview Execution

### Greet the Participants
We started by welcoming the participants. Then, we introduced ourselves and asked the participants to do the same. 

Following the introduction, we explained the purpose of the interview and obtained the participant's consent to participate and record the interview.

### Interview
We conducted the interview using the open questions below. We asked the participants to be precise or clarify points in their answers when needed. The goal was to let them stay on stage as long as possible without interruption to capture a more significant amount of "natural" information. Plan:

1. Ask a question.
2. Provide reflection time (2-3 minutes).
3. Record the answer.
4. Request precision (if necessary).
5. Repeat 1-4 while questions remain.
6. Finish the interview by asking:
```Is there any other subject you think is essential to share and that has not been mentioned yet? ```

### Post-interview

#### Produce minutes
After the interview, we produced minutes that contained the questions asked and participants' answers.

#### Minutes validation
We sent the interview minutes to the participants by e-mail and asked them to verify and validate the content. We recalled the participant one week later if we got no reply.
