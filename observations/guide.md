# Observations Guide
This guide was used to prepare, conduct and validate observations.

## Observation Preparation
1. Select the question from the question backlog which are related to the to the task to be conducted by the participant.

## Observation Execution

### Greet the Participants
We started by welcoming the participant. Then, we explained the purpose of the observation and obtained the participant's consent to participate.

### Observation
We conducted the observation using the open questions below. We asked the participants to be precise or clarify points in their answers when needed. Plan:

1. Ask about the task objective.
2. Ask the participant to describe the task as they conduct it.
3. Let the participant begin executing the task.
3. Note what is done.
4. Request precision (if necessary).
5. When the task is finished, read the notes to the participant, summarizing what has been conducted and the provided instructions.
6. Finish the observation by asking:
```
1. Is there any essential point I have passed by? 
2. Do you have any comments about the task you have performed?
3. Do you think this task is useful? Why?
4. Do you think the way you conduct this task is effective? Why?
5. How could this task execution be improved? Why?
```

### Post-observation

#### Create an observation journal entry
1. Note the key facts and summarize the task steps.
2. Note the emerging questions to be explored later (*postponed questions*).

#### Check process documentation 
Cross-check the task conducted against the process documentation to assess compliance and identify any deviations. Note the deviations for further discussion with the participants.

#### Triangulation
Link the key facts of the observation to concepts from the conceptual framework. Cross-check the findings with data collected during the interviews. Note the deviations for further discussion with participants.
